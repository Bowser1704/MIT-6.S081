if thread A and thread B find these entry.
  put thread A find the entry where its key should be.
  then put thread B also find the same entry
  A does this: e->value = value;
  B does also: e->value = value;
  so thread A's key lost.

if thread A and B want to insert a entry
  A does:
    e->next = n;
  B does:
    e->next = n;
  and the n is same.
  so thread A's key lost.
