Handle negative sbrk() arguments.
  ok
  if (n < 0)
    growproc();

Kill a process if it page-faults on a virtual memory address higher than any allocated with sbrk().
  ok
  if (va >= p->sz) p->killed = -1;

Handle the parent-to-child memory copy in fork() correctly.
  ok
  by continue rather than panic

Handle the case in which a process passes a valid address from sbrk() to a system call such as read or write, but the memory for that address has not yet been allocated.
  ok
  in the trap.c, add judgement of the type of system call.

Handle out-of-memory correctly: if kalloc() fails in the page fault handler, kill the current process.
  ok
  mem = kalloc();
  if(mem == 0) return -1;

Handle faults on the invalid page below the user stack.
  ok
  if (va <= PGROUNDDOWN(p->trapframe->sp)) p->killed = 1;
